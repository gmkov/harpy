Harpy is a haplotagging data processing pipeline for Linux-based systems. It uses all the 
magic of [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) under the hood to handle 
the worklfow decision-making, but as a user, you just interact with it like a normal command-line 
program. Harpy uses both well known and niche programs to take raw haplotagging sequences and process
them to become called SNP genotypes (or haplotypes). Most of the settings are pre-configured and the settings you
can modify are done at the command line. There aren't too many, which should make things a little simpler. 

## What is haplotagging?
Linked-read sequencing exists to combine the throughput and accuracy of short-read
sequencing with the long range haplotype information of long-read sequencing.
Haplotagging is an implementation of linked-read sequencing developed by
[Meier _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015005118) to:

1. sequence a large number of samples
2. achieve high molecular resolution
3. do both within a reasonable budget

If you don't have haplotagged data, then Harpy will likely be of little to no use to you. See the [haplotagging site](http://fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/chan-group/haplotagging/)
for more information about haplotagging and why you might consider it for your study system.


## Harpy Modules
Harpy is modular, meaning you can use different parts of it independent from each other. Need to only align reads?
Great! Only want to call variants? Awesome! All modules are called by `harpy <module>`. For example, use `harpy align` to align reads.

| Module     | Description                                   |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `extra`    | Create various associated or necessary files  |
| `trim`     | Remove adapters and quality trim sequences    |
| `align`    | Align sample sequences to a reference genome  |
| `variants` | Call variants from sample alignments          |
| `impute`   | Impute genotypes using variants and sequences |
| `phase`    | Phase SNPs into haplotypes                    |


## Using Harpy
You can call `harpy` without any arguments (or with `--help`) to print the docstring to your terminal. You can likewise call any of the modules with `--help` to see their usage  (e.g. `harpy align --help`).
``` harpy --help                                                      
 Usage: harpy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...                     
                                                              
               Haplotagging Research Pipeline (HARPY)               
                            version: 0.1                            
                                                                    
 The pipeline trims reads, maps sequences, calls variants, imputes  
 genotypes, and phases haplotypes using Haplotagging data.
